Assignment 1 - Guitar Hero

Interfaces and the classes that implement them are contained in the java file by the interface name:

GuitarBehavior.java contains GuitarBehavior interface, and all three classes that implement GuitarBehavior.

SoloBehavior.java contains SoloBehavior interface, and all three classes that implement SoloBehavior.

I did my best to avoid using "public" but was unsure of which visability modifier to use at some points.
